                Julie M Berryhill moved to Charlotte from the Midwest in 1996 and started in Real Estate in 1998 which has allowed
                her to witness and be a part of the exponential growth of the City . Julie has a passion for learning and remodels 
                homes on the side. There is very little that she can't figure out how to do. She has been a trainer at numerous jobs 
                and now has a passion for web development. Graduating from a full stack web development at the start of a pandemic 
                was a little tricky with everyone on a hiring freeze. She remodeled a house to fill some time and then re-enrolled 
                at UNC at Charlotte and is currently working on her bachelors degree for Computer Science. Please consider her for 
                a full-time entry-level position so she can finish her degree on the side and work her way up through a growing 
                company.
